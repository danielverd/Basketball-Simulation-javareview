# Basketball-Stats-project
A basic program used to roughly simulate basketball possessions using basic stats

Written in Java after my first semester of programming. I used one of my hobbies, basketball analytics, to help study for my programming final.
Basic functionality was implemented in Nov 2015.

Functions:
Input basic player data (shooting percentages, tendencies, name, and position)
Stores players in a position-based array, so players "know" which teammate they're passing to
Point guard advances the ball while dribbling
Triple threat position
Simulates a posession until a shot is made or missed
Stores game score

I plan to come back to this code and implement additional features to make the simulation less rudimentary. 

Future functions:
Three-point shots
Turnovers, blocks, steals (ends of posession other than shots)
Store basic counting stats for each player, which can be reviewed after the simulation closes (pts, reb, ass, blk, stl)
Better defense integration (strength of defense affects player percentages)
Calculate certain advanced stats after the simulation closes (+/-, TS%, PER)
Save a "post-game report" containing stats to a .txt file after the simulation closes
Load a .txt file with player stats to avoid the tedious data entry process
